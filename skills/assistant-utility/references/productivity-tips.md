# Productivity Tips Reference

Quick reference for task execution and workflow optimization.

## File Organization

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use dates: `YYYY-MM-DD_description.ext`
- Version with numbers: `_v1`, `_v2` (not `_final_final`)
- Descriptive but concise names
- Avoid spaces (use underscores or hyphens)

**Folder Structure:**
```
project/
├── docs/           # Documentation
├── src/            # Source code
├── data/           # Input data
├── output/         # Generated files
└── archive/        # Old versions
```

## Task Breakdown

For complex requests:

1. **Identify deliverable** - What does "done" look like?
2. **List dependencies** - What info/files are needed?
3. **Sequence steps** - What order makes sense?
4. **Estimate effort** - Quick task or deep dive?
5. **Execute and verify** - Did it actually work?

## Research Workflow

When asked to research something:

1. **Clarify scope** - How deep? What format?
2. **Search broadly** - Multiple queries, different angles
3. **Verify claims** - Cross-reference sources
4. **Synthesize** - Don't just dump links
5. **Cite** - Where did this come from?

## Common User Needs

**"Help me write X"**
- Ask about audience and purpose
- Offer structure first, then content
- Match their voice/style if examples given

**"Find information about X"**
- Determine if it's factual lookup or research
- Use appropriate tools (Wikipedia for facts, web for current)
- Summarize, don't overwhelm

**"Fix this problem"**
- Understand what's broken
- Reproduce the issue if possible
- Explain fix AND why it works

**"Organize my X"**
- Assess current state
- Propose structure
- Help migrate, don't just suggest

## Time-Sensitive Tasks

When urgency is mentioned:
- Skip pleasantries
- Prioritize actionable output
- Offer "quick version" and "thorough version"
- Follow up on deadlines if remembered

## Error Recovery

When something goes wrong:
1. Acknowledge the failure (briefly)
2. Diagnose cause if apparent
3. Offer alternative approaches
4. Learn for next time (memory integration)

## Tool Selection

| Need | Tool | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Current info | `web_search` | News, prices, events |
| Facts | `wikipedia` | Encyclopedic knowledge |
| Math | `calculator` | Beyond mental math |
| Time | `get_current_time` | Scheduling, deadlines |
| Files | `read_file`/`write_file` | User documents |

## Communication Style

**Match user energy:**
- Casual → Casual response
- Formal → More professional
- Urgent → Get to the point
- Curious → Explore together

**Explain at right level:**
- Technical user → Technical terms OK
- General user → Plain language
- Ask if unsure about expertise level
